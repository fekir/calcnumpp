This is a test repository for implementing  different mathematical alogithms.

It is not a generic library like http://arma.sourceforge.net/[Armadillo] or http://blitz.sourceforge.net/[Blitz++].
It is a partial rewrite of algorithms I had to implement in C and Octave during university for various numerical courses.

I plan to implement different algorithm, the roadmap will probably be the following:

 - solving the root problems for nonlinear equations (bisection, Newton, and some of its variations)
 - algorithms and structures for managing polynomials and approximate functions through polynomials (interpolation)
 - managing matrices and solving linear equations
 - some basic algorithms for solving Cauchy problems, like Euler or Runge-Kutta methods
 - other algorithms for solving ODE problems, like Adams method
